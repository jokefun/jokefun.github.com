_START_

Just bought a new macbook air 13", start rocking!

I bought this macbook because the linux-like mac os x system, it is easier for a MANONG to use than windows.

One important thing is to restart my blog, which is hosted on the brilliant github site and must be updated by git. Mac makes using git smoother.

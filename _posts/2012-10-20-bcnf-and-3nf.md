## BCNF

BCNF is _Boycd-Codd normal form_.

A relational schema R is in Boyce–Codd normal form if and only if for every one of its dependencies X → Y, at least one of the following conditions hold:

 * X → Y is a trivial functional dependency (Y ⊆ X)
 * X is a superkey for schema R
 
## 3NF

3NF is _Third normal form_.

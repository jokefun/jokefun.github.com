title: BCNF and 3NF
---

## BCNF

BCNF is _Boycd-Codd normal form_.

A relational schema R is in Boyce–Codd normal form if and only if for every one of its dependencies X → Y, at least one of the following conditions hold:

 * X → Y is a trivial functional dependency (Y ⊆ X)
 * X is a superkey for schema R
 
## 3NF

3NF is _Third normal form_.

3NF states that X → Y holds over R:

 * X → Y is trivial
 * X is superkey
 * A is a member of some key for R
 
## Difference

BCNF is more strict than 3NF. BCNF needs that left part be superkey. But 3NF needs that left be superkey, if not, the right part be part of some key.

There is an example which is 3NF but not BCNF. For relation

> (a, b, c, d)

The dependencies

 * abc->d,
 * d->a
